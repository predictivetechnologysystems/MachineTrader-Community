# MachineTrader-Community
This is a community repository for MachineTrader users who want to upload or share json files to be used in MachineTrader instances.  Json files can be used to implement and execute algorithmic trading strategies. The easiest method for downloading the json files you'll need is to click the green "Code"  button to the right, and then download zip files. You'll then be able to "Import" the json files into your instance as you need them.

Before attempting to upload any of these json scripts, we highly recommend reviewing the MachineTrader "Intro to Nodes and Flows" video in the video training library by clicking here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sZTaXBhRjyAKSIIaxdYJ8Lh2xVoUtV_8/view?usp=sharing
